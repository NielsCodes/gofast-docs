## What is GoFast?

The Ultimate Foundation for High-Performance, Scalable Web Applications with the Power of Golang and SvelteKit/Next.js.

This is an opinioned skeleton that aims to help you build applications that will last.

This is not the next "template" one that includes 90% of thrash you will never use.

You will need to code.

## Philisophy

- We believe that the combination of backend language and frontend framework is the best one.
- The backbone of the app is Go, which handles all the important logic. Why Go?:
    - Go is a super simple language while also having one of the best performances available.
    - One of its undervalued strengths is how easy it is to introduce to new programmers.
    - Also, because of how straightforward Go is, there aren't "thousands" of ways to do things, so it's much easier to review the code and keep it consistent.
    - Go has an amazing set of native libraries.
- The frontend app we advocate for is SvelteKit, but we also see the value in Next.js and its popularity.
