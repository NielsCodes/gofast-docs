## What is GoFast?

The Ultimate Foundation for High-Performance, Scalable Web Applications with the Power of Golang and SvelteKit/Next.js.

This is an opinioned skeleton that aims to help you build applications that will last.

This is not the next "template" one that includes 90% of thrash you will never use.

You will need to code.

## Philisophy

- We belive that a backend using Go and any frontened framework is the best commbination as of now:
    - Go is super simple, very performant and have anmazing native libs.
