## Configuration

To change the current provider, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the corresponding secrets.

To include more providers, follow these steps in the `file/provider.go` file, which holds the logic:

1. Add the new provider to the `Provider` constant.
2. Create a new provider struct.
3. Add the required methods to the new struct.
4. Add any new secrets in the `env.go` file.
