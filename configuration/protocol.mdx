## Configuration

This choice must be done using GoFast CLI. A few points to notice:

- HTTP implementation will remove all gRPC code, proto files and libraries.
- gRPC implementation will still have some HTTP routes:
    - One for payments webhook.
    - Second for files functionality. gRPC is just not the best solution to handle file uploads and downloads.

### gRPC generation

For gRPC implementation, all proto files are inside `proto` folder. After making any changes, we need to generate new types for both sever and client.

```bash
sh proto.sh
```

This script will take care of types generation, but it depends on two librabries, so make sure you have them globallly installed:

- protoc
- proto-loader-gen-types
