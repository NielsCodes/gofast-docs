## Configuration

This choice must be made using the **GoFast CLI**. Possible options are `HTTP` and `gRPC`.

## Implementation Details

- **HTTP** implementation will remove all gRPC code, proto files and libraries.
- **gRPC** implementation uses streams for all queries, and unary for all mutations.
- **gRPC** implementation will still have some HTTP routes:
    - Payments webhook.
    - Files functionality. gRPC is just not the best solution to handle file uploads and downloads.

## gRPC generation

For gRPC implementation, all proto files are inside the `proto` folder. After making any changes, we need to generate new types for both the server and client.

```bash
sh proto.sh
```

This script will take care of type generation and propagation, but it depends on two libraries, so make sure you have them globally installed:

- `protoc`
- `proto-loader-gen-types`

```
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
```
