## Configuration

This choice must be made using the GoFast CLI.

- HTTP implementation will remove all gRPC code, proto files and libraries.
- gRPC implementation will still have some HTTP routes:
    - One for the payments webhook.
    - Another for files functionality. gRPC is just not the best solution to handle file uploads and downloads.

### gRPC generation

For gRPC implementation, all proto files are inside the `proto` folder. After making any changes, we need to generate new types for both the server and client.

```bash
sh proto.sh
```

This script will take care of type generation and propagation, but it depends on two libraries, so make sure you have them globally installed:

- protoc
- proto-loader-gen-types
