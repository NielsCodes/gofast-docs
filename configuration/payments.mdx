Configuration

The payments implementation can generate the client Checkout Session to process payments, the Customer Portal to check invoices, and includes a Webhook implementation to listen for changes.
The flow is as follows:

1. The user clicks the subscribe button, sending a request to the backend.
2. The backend generates a Checkout URL.
3. The user completes the order.
4. A webhook on the backend listens for changes and updates the client's status accordingly.
5. After the client is created in the payment provider, they can visit their customer portal to check all invoices.
