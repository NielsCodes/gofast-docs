## Configuration

The OAuth implementation does not depend on any external providers. It's built using the `golang.org/x/oauth2` library. 
The base application already includes configurations for two providers: Google and GitHub.

To include more providers, follow these steps in the oauth.go file, which holds the logic:

1. Add new secrets in the env.go file.
2. Add the new provider to the Provider constant.
3. Create a new provider struct.
4. Add the required methods to the new struct.
