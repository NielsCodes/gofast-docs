## Configuration

This choice must be made using the GoFast CLI.

- We heavily utilize SSR.
- We keep the frameworks up to date.
- We use `Form Action` for SvelteKit and `Server Actions` for NextJS.
- The logic is extracted to the `server/services` folder. The route pages try to have as little logic as possible, only passing the required parameters.
- We strongly advocate for the Component Composition pattern.
