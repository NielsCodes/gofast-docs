## Configuration

This choice must be done using GoFast CLI.

- We heavly utilize SSR.
- We keep the frameworks up to date.
- We use `Form Action` for SvelteKit and `Server Actions` for NextJS.
- The logic is extracted to `server/services` folder. The route pages try to have as less logic as possible, only passing required paramters.
- We strongly advocates for Component Composition pattern.
