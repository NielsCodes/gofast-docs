## Configuration

This choice must be made using the **GoFast CLI**.

- We heavily utilize SSR.
- We keep the frameworks up to date.
- We use `Form Action` for SvelteKit and `Server Actions` for NextJS.
- The logic is extracted to the `server/services` folder. The route pages try to have as little logic as possible, only passing the required parameters.
- We strongly advocate for the Component Composition pattern.

## Troubleshoting

- When running Vite on WSL2, file system watching does not work when a file is edited by Windows applications (non-WSL2 process). Check Vite docs for solutions: https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-watch
