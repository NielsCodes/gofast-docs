## Configuration

To change the current provider, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the corresponding secrets.

To include more providers, follow these steps in the `/storage.go` file, which holds the logic:

1. Add the new provider to the `Provider` constant.
2. Create a new provider function that returns database driver and cleanup functions.
3. Add any new secrets / database parameters in the `env.go` file.

### SQLite

The only environment variable required here is `SQLITE_FILE`, which points to the file location of the database.

This is also the default configuration when building the base project, with a modern setup:

```go
var pragmas = []string{
	"PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;",
	"PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;",
	"PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;",
	"PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;",
	"PRAGMA auto_vacuum = INCREMENTAL;",
	"PRAGMA cache_size = 10000;",
	"PRAGMA cache = shared;",
}
```

This is more than enough for 90% of applications. For backups, you can use:

```bash
sqlite3 local.db '.backup local.db.bak'
```
