## Configuration

To change the current provider, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the corresponding secrets.

To include more providers, follow these steps in the `/storage.go` file, which holds the logic:

1. Add the new provider to the `Provider` constant.
2. Create a new provider function that returns database driver and cleanup functions.
3. Add any new secrets / database parameters in the `env.go` file.
